			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This is version 1.0 of the API and is a RESTful API based on HTTP requests and JSON responses. It gives the user the ability to do many of the functionalities that they would be able to do on the website through various API endpoints.
			</p>
			<p>
				It uses <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> which means all requests will need to be encrypted and sent via HTTPS for security reasons. This allows anyone to programatically use the API endpoints to perform any operation that they could have performed on the website.
			</p>

		<section id="app-creation">
			<h2>Creating an App/Registration</h2>
			<p>
				Before you can begin, using the API you will need to first <a href="{{ url_for('api.create_client') }}">register</a> a new application (Client) with server. When registering a new app you need to enter a valid application name and chose an token endpoint authentication method that will determine how authorization request will be performed. Once submitted you will be presented with details of the client including client_id and possibly client_secret, note them down or you can view a list of applications created in the application tab <a href="{{ url_for('imager.settings') }}">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The grant type that the application will use by default is the <b>Client Credentials</b>. This does not require a resource owner(User) approval like with other grants but allows the client(Third party application) to access protected resources i.e API endpoints based on whether they have the authorization scope of the client.

				Then there's the client authentication methods, this determines how the client will communicate with the authorization server after the app is created. After creating an app, two tokens will be created <b>client_id</b> and possibly a <b>client_secret</b> if not none. They include the following options:
				<ol>
					<li><b>client_secret_post</b>:Both client_id and client_secret tokens are required to be presented as a parameter of any request to the Authorization server where they'll be checked if they're valid for that specific client.
					</li>

					<li><b>client_secret_basic</b>:
						Here a string is created joining the client_id and client_secret for example: "{client_id}:{client_secret}". Next the string will be encoded with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648" target="_blank">BASE64</a>. Finally, embed the BASE64 encoded string in the Authorization header in a token request for example: Authorization: Basic {BASE64-encoded Credentials}
					</li>

					<li><b>none</b>: Client authentication is not required so any request will go through.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="authorization">
			<h2>Authorization</h2>
			<p>
				Once the application is registered, the service will issue client credentials in the form of a <b>client_id</b> and a <b>client_secret</b>. client_id is a publicly exposed string that's used by the service API to identify the application, and is also used to build authorization URLs that are presented to users. The client_secret however is used to authenticate the identity of the application to the service API when the application requests to access a user's account, and must be kept private between the application and the API.
			</p>

			<p>
				Using the client_id and possibly the client_secret the client requires to obtain the following before being able to access the resource server(API):
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Access Token</b>
					</li>
					<p>
						The access token is required for any client request to be able to  successfully access protected resources from the resource source(API), and will need to be embeded in any request's header. The access token is expected to expire after a period of time.
					</p>

					<li>
						<b>Refresh Token</b>
					</li>
					<p>
						The refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens once the access tokens have expired, where it is long lasting.
					</p>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The following steps are needed to be done by a client to be authorized to access the resource server (API) after an application has been created:
				<ol>
					<li>The client must first request for an access token from the Authorization Server by sending its credentials, this include its <b>client_id</b> and possibly its <b>client_secret</b>.</li>
					<li>If the client's credentials check out, the authorization server returns an access token and a refresh token to the client.</li>
					<li>Now the client is authorized to use its own account, and will need to append the access token in the header to access various API endpoints.</li>
				</ol>
